Dear (name),

We hope this email finds you well. Hector Bahamonde (assistant professor at O'Higgins University, in Chile), and myself, Thiago Nascimento da Silva (PhD candidate, at TAMU), are putting together a panel for APSA 2019. 

Our panel will be comprised of papers related to topics on state formation/capacity, fiscal development, and distribution/inequality, within the Latin American context. Both quantitative and/or qualitative approaches are welcome, as are long or short-term, structural or behavioral, or single/multiple-cases approaches. 

We believe your research is well-suited for inclusion at APSA 2019, and that your presence and research would be a great benefit to our panel.

I am presenting a paper with Victor Araújo (Ph.D. student at the University of Zurich) on fiscal capacity and political competition with evidence from Brazilian municipalities. Bahamonde is presenting on the positive effects of implementing the income tax on state capacity over time in Latin America. He is also developing a new dataset to test state-capacity overtime.

Bahamonde and I plan to chair the panel. In order to secure your spot, please let us know if you would or would not like to participate in the panel by November 15. Your presence and contribution to this conference’s panel would be greatly welcomed.

With our best wishes,

Hector Bahamonde and Thiago Nascimento da Silva
