# Proposal

Dear (name),

I hope this email finds you well. Hector Bahamonde (assistant professor at O'Higgins University, in Chile) and myself (PhD candidate, at TAMU) are working on putting a panel together for the next APSA 2019. 

We were thinking that your research matches really well with what we want to achieve. And also, we think that having you with us, would really boost our panel!

The general idea of our panel is to have papers touching upon topics on state formation/capacity, fiscal development, distribution/inequality, within the Latin American context. Both quantitative and/or qualitative approaches work for us. Also, long or short-term, structural or behavioral, or single/multiple-cases approaches should work for us too. Depending on the rest of the speakers, the description of our panel might change.

So you know what to expect from us, we (that's you and your coauthor) are presenting on XYZ, while Bahamonde's presenting on the positive effects of implementing the income tax on state capacity overtime in Latin America. He also develops a new dataset to test state-capacity overtime.

Bahamonde plans on chairing the panel, and we're working on getting an external person to discuss the papers. We have in mind a more senior person. For now, he's to TBA.

Please, let us know if you'd like to join us. We know that time is scarce, and that you should be really busy. However, in order to move forward quickly, we would really appreciate it if you could let us know within the next 10 days if you would like to join us.

With our very best wishes,

Bahamonde and Silva.
