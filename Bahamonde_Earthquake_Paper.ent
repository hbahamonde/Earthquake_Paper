macro:->As
\textcite
{Boix:2015aa}
explains,
lower
levels
of
inter-elite
economic
inequality
are
tied
to
similar
degrees
of
military
capabilities.
Under
these
circumstances,
war
is
most
likely
to
exhaust
all
existent
assets
without
producing
positive
outcomes
for
either
sector
(Richard
Salvucci,
in
\cite
[48]{Uribe-Uran:2001aa}),
leading
to
heavier
pressures
to
reach
agreements
instead
of
engaging
in
armed
conflicts.
In
Chile,
while
initially
both
``antagonistic
elites''
\parencite
[37-38]{Keller1931},
confronted
each
other
in
two
bloody
civil
wars
between
a
``large
landed
property
[elite
against
a]
productive
capital[ist]
[elite]''
\parencite
[23]{Zeitlin:1984aa},
due
to
low
levels
of
inequality,
war
was
not
sustainable
over
time.
For
instance,
while
\emph
{Balmacedistas}
managed
to
secure
the
support
of
the
army,
\emph
{congresistas}
(the
anti-Balmaceda
group)
gathered
support
from
the
navy.
Similarly,
in
the
subsequent
years
of
the
civil
war,
there
were
a
number
of
\emph
{aborted}
coups,
in
1907,
1912,
1915,
and
1919
(in
\cite
[109]{Collier:2002db}),
suggesting
an
equilibrium
where
no
elite
was
the
leading
elite.
