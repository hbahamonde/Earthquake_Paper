The central argument of this paper is that income taxation fostered via spillover effects increases state-consolidation over time in Chile. The paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it studies the relationship between taxation and state building outside Europe. Second, the paper tests the theory using a novel approach. Exploiting the exogeneity of earthquake shocks, I create a novel hand-collected longitudinal dataset on Chilean earthquake death tolls was leveraged. Under reasonable assumptions, the capacity for enforcing and monitoring building codes throughout the territory is a reflection of a state's overall capacities. The paper shows that death tolls decrease (that is, state capacity increases) once the income tax law was implemented in 1924 using a Bayesian Poisson regression to test the effect of implementing the income tax law on death tolls between 1900 and 2010. To control for unmeasured sources of variation, the model also leverages a fixed-effects approach. To explore the causal mechanisms at work, I discuss the Chilean case since the 1920s.
