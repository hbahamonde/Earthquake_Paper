The central argument of this paper is that income taxation fostered, via spillover effects, state-consolidation overtime in Chile. The presence of tax assessors and collectors throughout the territory increased norms of enforcement of state regulations more generally, fostering overall state-capacities over time. Exploiting the exogeneity of earthquake shocks, a novel hand-collected longitudinal dataset on Chilean earthquake death tolls was leveraged. Using a Bayesian Poisson regression to test the effect of implementing the income tax law on death-tolls between 1900 and 2010, suggest that death-tolls decrease (that is, state capacity increase) once the income tax law is implemented. This identification strategy contends that the capacity for enforcing and monitoring building codes throughout the territory is a reflection of a state's overall capacities. To explore the causal mechanisms at work in more depth, I discuss the Chilean case since the 1920s.
