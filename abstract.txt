I argue that higher levels of sectoral competition increased state-capacities over time. Specifically, I explain how the emergence of industrial elites lowered levels of inter-sectoral inequality, pushing the agricultural and industrial elites to reach agreements that materialized in investments in state-making institutions, causing in turn higher state-capacities. Exploiting the exogeneity of earthquake shocks, I leverage a novel intertemporal dataset on Chilean earthquake death tolls and a Bayesian multilevel Poisson model to account for state capacities between 1900 and 2010. My identification strategy contends that the capacity the state has of enforcing and monitoring building codes throughout the territory is a reflection of its overall state capacities. To explore the causal mechanisms at work more deeply, I leverage the Chilean case, presenting some historical evidence showing that the rise of the industrial economic sector pushed agricultural and industrial political elites to invest in state-making institutions, particularly, the implementation of the income tax law. What my empirical analyses show are twofolds. Death-tolls decrease, that is, state capacities increase, (1) when levels of sectoral contestation increase overtime, and (2) once the income tax law is implemented, finding support for the fiscal sociology paradigm, and particularly for the idea that direct taxation causes state-building.
