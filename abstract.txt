I argue that higher levels of sectoral economic competition increased state-capacities over time. Specifically, I explain how the emergence of industrial elites posed credible threats to the landowning elites, pushing both groups to reach agreements. I identify one such agreement, the income tax law. From a fiscal sociology standpoint, this institution was important for state-making and state-capacities. Exploiting the exogeneity of earthquake shocks, I leverage a novel hand-collected intertemporal dataset on Chilean earthquake death tolls and a Bayesian multilevel Poisson model to account for state capacities between 1900 and 2010. My identification strategy contends that the capacity the state has of enforcing and monitoring building codes throughout the territory is a reflection of its overall state capacities. What my empirical analyses show are twofolds. Death-tolls decrease, that is, state capacities increase, (1) when levels of sectoral contestation increase overtime, and (2) once the income tax law is implemented, finding support for the fiscal sociology paradigm, and particularly for the idea that direct taxation causes state-building. To explore the causal mechanisms at work more deeply, I present the Chilean case.
