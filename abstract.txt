The central argument of this paper is that income taxation fostered, via spillover effects, state-consolidation over time in Chile. The paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it studies the relationship between taxation and state-building outside Europe. Second, the paper tests the theory using a novel approach. Exploiting the exogeneity of earthquake shocks, a novel hand-collected longitudinal dataset on Chilean earthquake death tolls was leveraged. Under reasonable assumptions, the capacity for enforcing and monitoring building codes throughout the territory is a reflection of a state's overall capacities. Using a Bayesian Poisson regression to test the effect of implementing the income tax law on death-tolls between 1900 and 2010, the paper shows that death-tolls decrease (that is, state capacity increases) once the income tax law is implemented in 1924. To control for unmeasured sources of variation, the model leverages also a fixed-effects approach. To explore the causal mechanisms at work, I discuss the Chilean case since the 1920s.
