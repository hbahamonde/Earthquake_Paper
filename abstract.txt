The central argument of this paper is that income taxation fostered, via spillover effects, state-consolidation overtime in Chile. The presence of tax assessors and collectors throughout the territory increased norms of enforcement of state regulations more generally, fostering overall state-capacities over time. In turn, the paper explains that the implementation of the income tax was product of sustained levels of sectoral contestation. Exploiting the exogeneity of earthquake shocks, I leverage a novel hand-collected longitudinal dataset on Chilean earthquake death tolls and a Bayesian multilevel Poisson model to estimate levels of state capacities between 1900 and 2010. My identification strategy contends that the capacity for enforcing and monitoring building codes throughout the territory is a reflection of a state's overall capacities. The results strongly suggest that death-tolls decrease, that is, state capacities increase once the income tax law is implemented. To explore the causal mechanisms at work in more depth, I discuss the Chilean case since the 1920s.
